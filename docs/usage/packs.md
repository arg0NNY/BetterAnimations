# Packs

Packs are collections of Animations.

> [!NOTE]
> Internal Animations that come preinstalled with _BetterAnimations_ are also a part of a pack.
> See [source code](https://github.com/arg0NNY/BetterAnimations/blob/main/shared/packs/preinstalled.pack.json).

## Catalog & Library

**Catalog & Library** allow you to browse, install and manage official and verified community-made packs
right within the plugin settings.

To install a pack, click on the <img src="../assets/img/catalog-install.png" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom" /> button
in the pack card. After the pack is installed, its animations will be available for selection at the bottom of the module settings.
