## Guidelines

Applicable [BetterDiscord Guidelines](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/themes/introduction/guidelines) apply, along with the following:
1. Animations of the Pack must negatively affect users (e.g. by breaking Discord's layout and styles).
2. Packs and its Animations must not leverage any bugs or vulnerabilities of _BetterAnimations_.
3. Your Pack's codebase must be made and written primarily by you.
   - You may not publish an automatically generated Pack (AI or otherwise), a customized version of someone else's Pack, or a codebase written by someone other than you.
4. Packs must use English as the primary language.
5. _Slug_ (`{slug}.pack.json`) of a Pack and [`key`](/reference/animation#key)s of its Animations must be in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).

The above guidelines are subject to change.
