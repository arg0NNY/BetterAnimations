## Guidelines

Applicable [BetterDiscord Guidelines](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/themes/introduction/guidelines) apply, along with the following:
1. Animations of the Pack must not negatively affect users (e.g. by breaking Discord's layout and styles).
2. Packs and its Animations must not leverage any bugs or vulnerabilities of _BetterAnimations_.
3. Animations of a Pack must clean up all changes/modifications made during the execution with an exception to Animations for [Modals -> Backdrop](/usage/modules#modals-backdrop).
4. Pack must not have any usages of inject <InjectRef inject="debug" /> and [Debug Mode](./debug-mode).
5. Packs must use English as the primary language.
6. _Slug_ (`{slug}.pack.json`) of a Pack and [`key`](/reference/animation#key)s of its Animations must be in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).

The above guidelines are subject to change.
