# Accordions

**Accordions** is an alternative naming of [Expand/Collapse Animations](/usage/basics#expand-collapse-animations).

_BetterAnimations_ provides internal Accordions implementation users can enable for any of the Animations.
However, you may want to natively integrate them in your Animations.
